# Vchat-App
I developed a real-time chat application using Socket.IO, allowing users to communicate instantly. The app features live updates, user connection and disconnection notifications, and supports multiple chat rooms. It leverages a Node.js server to manage WebSocket connections and efficiently handle messaging. The front-end is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a responsive and interactive user experience. This application ensures seamless and real-time communication, making it ideal for dynamic and interactive web environments.
In order to run the vchat application you need make a html file (index.html) , a css file (style.css) , a server (app.js) and client(client.js) that connect to the server.
# prerequisites - you to need to run two this two lines in your terminal 
first you need to make nodeServer file in vs code and then run `npm init` and enter you basic details .
now make a app.js and run `npm install socket.io-client` 
# make the server live 
enter into the nodeServer file (`cd .\nodeServer)
run the following command - nodemon .\app.js
and your server is live 
# now it is ready for a realtime interaction.
